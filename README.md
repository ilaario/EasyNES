# EasyNES
A simple NES emulator written in C. The project is still WIP, I'm going to update this readme while I write the code. At the current state, the emulator read the `.nes` file and allocate the ROM sections.
### Goal
The goal of this emulator is to pass all 128 accuracy tests contained in [100thCoin/AccuracyCoin](https://github.com/100thCoin/AccuracyCoin).
